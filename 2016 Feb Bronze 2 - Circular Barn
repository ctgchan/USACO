/*
Being a fan of contemporary architecture, Farmer John has built a new barn in the shape of a perfect circle. Inside, the barn consists of a ring of n
 rooms, numbered clockwise from 1…n
 around the perimeter of the barn (3≤n≤1,000
). Each room has doors to its two neighboring rooms, and also a door opening to the exterior of the barn.
Farmer John wants exactly ri
 cows to end up in each room i
 (1≤ri≤100
). To herd the cows into the barn in an orderly fashion, he plans to unlock the exterior door of a single room, allowing the cows to enter through that door. Each cow then walks clockwise through the rooms until she reaches a suitable destination. Farmer John wants to unlock the exterior door that will cause his cows to collectively walk a minimum total amount of distance. Please determine the minimum total distance his cows will need to walk, if he chooses the best such door to unlock. The distance walked by a single cow is the number of interior doors through which she passes.

INPUT FORMAT (file cbarn.in):
The first line of input contains n
. Each of the remaining n
 lines contain r1…rn
.
OUTPUT FORMAT (file cbarn.out):
Please write out the minimum total amount of distance the cows collectively need to travel.
