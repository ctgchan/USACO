/*
Bessie and her cow friends are playing as their favorite cow superheroes. Of course, everyone knows that any self-respecting superhero needs a signal to call them to action. Bessie has drawn a special signal on a sheet of M×N
 paper (1≤M≤10,1≤N≤10
), but this is too small, much too small! Bessie wants to amplify the signal so it is exactly K
 times bigger (1≤K≤10
) in each direction.
The signal will consist only of the '.' and 'X' characters.

INPUT FORMAT (file cowsignal.in):
The first line of input contains M
, N
, and K
, separated by spaces.
The next M
 lines each contain a length-N
 string, collectively describing the picture of the signal.

OUTPUT FORMAT (file cowsignal.out):
You should output KM
 lines, each with KN
 characters, giving a picture of the enlarged signal.
